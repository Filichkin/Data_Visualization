Lately, clients and reviewers want to see pie charts arranged in two columns on one page.
For that I created a small function that takes a data frame and a list of categorical features of any length.
There is also a small example of placing histograms and boxplots in the same field.
As usual, I use Plotly tools to create beautiful and useful diagrams.
